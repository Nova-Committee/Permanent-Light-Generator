# Permanent Light Generator: Refabricated

A bad clone of Permanent Light Generator for Fabric.

Currently WIP.

The project is licensed under MIT. Feel free to use anything.

## Contribution Rules

If you want to contribute to this project, use GitHub Desktop first. If you cannot push your commit via GitHub Desktop (Not wanting to download and use GitHub Desktop is strictly not included), then use Git. Forcing Git to push your commit is _STRICTLY NOT ALLOWED_, because that might erase history commits by other contributors.

However, if you REALLY, REALLY need to force Git to push your commit, you'll need to try to mention all the contributors and all their contributions _more conspicuously_ than your commit.
